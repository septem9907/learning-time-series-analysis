This stuff is about the famous paper 
"Foundations of Technical Analysis: Computational Algorithms, Statistical Inference, and Empirical Implementation" 
by ANDREW W. LO, HARRY MAMAYSKY, AND JIANG WANG, which was mentioned in the book.
As I reported, I was NOT able to reproduce their results with a more recent data. 
You may read more in "Reproducing Lo - TA with kernel regression.pdf". 

In order to make my R code run do (at your own risk!) the following:
1. Put the content to the directory D:\BOOK\WEBSITE\ReproducingLo (alternatively, change R code according to your folder)
2. Install R 2.13.2 (earlier version shall do, but later not since the package "msProcess" was dropped from CRAN)
3. Run 32 Bit Version of R (due to package RODBC)
4. Run setup.r to install required packages
